Firebase Cloud Messaging Quickstart
===================================

The Firebase Cloud Messaging quickstart demonstrates how to:
- Request permission to send app notifications to the user.
- Receive FCM messages using the Firebase Cloud Messaging JavaScript SDK.

Introduction

- [Read more about Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/)

Getting Started
---------------

1. Set up your project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Paste initialization snippet into `index.html` with the one generated from
   the Firebase Console **Overview > Add Firebase to your web app**. See TODO in
   `index.html`.
3. Run the app
     - Install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/)
     - Use command `firebase serve -p 8081` to serve app locally.
     - Open http://localhost:8081 in your browser.
4. Click REQUEST PERMISSION button to request permission for the app to send
   notifications to the browser.
5. Use the generated Instance ID token to send an HTTP request to FCM that
   delivers the message to the web application, inserting appropriate values
   for [YOUR-SERVER-KEY](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/cloudmessaging)
   and YOUR-IID-TOKEN.

### HTTP
```
POST /fcm/send HTTP/1.1
Host: fcm.googleapis.com
Authorization: key=YOUR-SERVER-KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Portugal vs. Denmark",
    "body": "5 to 1",
    "icon": "firebase-logo.png",
    "click_action": "http://localhost:8081"
  },
  "to": "YOUR-IID-TOKEN"
}
```

### cURL
```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: key=YOUR-SERVER-KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Portugal vs. Denmark",
    "body": "5 to 1",
    "icon": "firebase-logo.png",
    "click_action": "http://localhost:8081"
  },
  "to": "YOUR-IID-TOKEN"
}' "https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send"
```

- When the app has the browser focus , the received message is handled through
  the `onMessage` callback in index.html. When the app does not have browser
  focus then the `setBackgroundMessageHandler` callback in firebase-messaging-sw.js
  is where the received message is handled.

### App focus
The browser gives your app focus when both:

1. Your app is running in the currently selected browser tab.
2. The browser tab's window currently has focus, as defined by the operating system.
